# Resources

1. This activity will use the Numbers API: http://numbersapi.com/

2. To review how to use Node.js to build a backend web service that retrives information based on a POST request from the frontend.

# Instructions

The purpose of this project is to use async/await by fetching data from the Numbers API. Your project must accept user input that is a number and upon submission of the number, a trivia fact about that number is returned to the user in the frontend.

1. Important: Review the Numbers API documentation in the Resources section to figure out how to get data as JSON.

2. Create your Node project (note: you can create a stand alone project with Node and Express, or your can deploy a Lambda function in AWS using Node):

3. Set up your folder structure and files. Create your routes. And write the JS to call the API, receive the data, and return it to your user (the frontend).

4. Use Postman to test your API calls.
